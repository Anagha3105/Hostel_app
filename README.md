# Hostel_app
SPACEJAM PROJECT


Staying in the girls’ hostel makes a lot of things more convenient , but at the same time, quite a few of the procedures prove to be a hassle. Having to fill forms every time we leave the hostel, or simply just the communication gap between the students and the warden! So our group, 404 NOT FOUND has decided to make to make a web application for the hostelites to make everyone’s life simpler! 

## How to view website:


Open home.html, all pages are linked to that.

loginsys.py is a tkinter code used to log in to the site and greets user with their name henceforth.

chatbot_with_flask.py is a chatbot that answers questions about the hostel and facilities. 

The same chatbot has been implemented using tkinter under chatbot.py. 

This is a rule-based chatbot, and in further development we hope to use ML and NLP to train the model to be even more accurate and useful.

This is a prototype model and has not been deployed.
